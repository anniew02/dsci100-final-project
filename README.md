# DSCI 100 Final Project
We used knn-classification to determine whether or not we can predict visitor type (new or returning visitor). To make such a prediction, we used 2 numerical variables: product-related duration (the amount of time spent on product-related pages) and informational duration (the amount of time speant on informational pages). 

## Research Question: 
Can we predict visitor type based on their amount of time spent on product-related and infromational pages? 

## Dataset: 
"Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset" from UC Irvineâ€™s Machine Learning Repository
